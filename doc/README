== Important changes since the 2007.2 release ==
* New audio module with support for some more advanced audio features.
* Optimized view code to improve the performance and resolve map instance z-order issues.
* Switched back to island_demo concept; this will be the techdemo that ships with future FIFE releases as well.
* Floating text renderer.
* Improved virtual file system code for editor tool.
* Vastly improved pychan extension.
* Quadtree adjustments.
* Basic mouse map instance picking.
* Editor tool (still work in progress).

== Features ==
* A complete list of the features that FIFE offers can be found at the project wiki:

== Building FIFE ==
=== Dependencies ===
A list of all dependencies (including accurate version numbers) that you'll need to obtain to build FIFE on your platform can be found at the project wiki:
http://wiki.fifengine.de/index.php?title=Build_dependencies

=== General notes ===
FIFE utilizes the SCons (http://www.scons.org) build system. Here is a quick list of scons commands that can be important for building FIFE on your platform:
* 'scons ext=1' will build the FIFE dependencies Guichan (http://guichan.sourceforge.net/) and minizip (http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/minizip.html) from bundled source. Use this if you do not have these libraries, or have the wrong version.
* 'scons -h' will list additional compile options.
* 'scons' will build FIFE.
* 'scons tests=1' will build FIFE and the boost unit tests (needed for test_fife.py).
* 'scons -c' clears any compiled objects (= scons equivalent of 'make clean').

Platform specific details how to build FIFE can be found down below.

=== Linux ===
Detailed information how to build FIFE on Linux-based distributions can be found at the project wiki:
http://wiki.fifengine.de/index.php?title=Building:Linux:SCons

After FIFE has been built successfully move into the <FIFE>/clients/island_demo directory and run: python island_demo.py

=== Mac ===
Detailed information how to build FIFE on linux-based distributions can be found at the project wiki:
http://wiki.fifengine.de/index.php?title=Mac_compile_guide

Caution: the Mac compile guide is currently heavily outdated! We would like to improve this situation but we're lacking a Mac maintainer who could take care of that. In case you're interested in the position feel free to get in contact with our developers on the project's IRC channel:
http://wiki.fifengine.de/index.php?title=IRC

In case you manage to build FIFE on your Mac system you can move into the <FIFE>/clients/island_demo directory and run: python island_demo.py

=== Win32 ===
The Win32 package ships with precompiled binaries. Simply unpack the package to location of your choice. After that you'll need to install ActivePython 2.5 to run the techdemo:
http://downloads.activestate.com/ActivePython/windows/2.5/ActivePython-2.5.1.1-win32-x86.msi

Move into the <FIFE>\clients\island_demo directory and start the island_demo.py script. You can simply double-click with your mouse on it. It should be automatically associated with the Python interpreter after installing ActivePython.

== Configuring FIFE ==
The engine utilizes special settings files for configuring FIFE. For the island_demo the file is called "techdemo_settings.py" and resides in the same directory as the island_demo.py script. You can customize FIFE by editing this file.

== Known issues ==
* Map instance blocking is currently buggy on the island_demo map.
* Win32 users tend to suffer from problems with the OpenAL drivers. If you don't hear the background music playing while running the techdemo, run oalinst.exe that ships with the Win32 package. This is the latest OpenAL driver for Win32.
* The boost unit tests are broken on Win32. We plan to address this issue but we're lacking active Win32 developers to look into these kind of problems as the vast majority of the active developers is set on Linux. If you would like to help out with Win32-related issues please contact us at our IRC channel:
http://wiki.fifengine.de/index.php?title=IRC

== Feedback ==
We appreciate every kind of feedback concerning the release, the project in general and the bundled techdemo. Feedback is a great way to help us to improve FIFE. If you would like to get in contact with us and provide feedback you can either visit our IRC channel or our forums:

== Signature ==
Have fun with the release and let us know what you think about it!
