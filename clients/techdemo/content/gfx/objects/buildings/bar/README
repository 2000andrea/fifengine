Here are the splitted up objects in an untextured version.

I have splitted the building-walls.

Now there are is one monolithic wall and several smaller splitted up wall-tiles so you can use what you need.

There is a description that explains where each wall tile belongs to.

Tables and chairs are only featured for one direction. Later we can add more versions as soon as the textured objects are available. For now the current versions should be sufficent for testing.

There is also a reference picture of the bar so you got an idea how object placement should look like.

Have fun with them.
