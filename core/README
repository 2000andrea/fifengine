[FIXME]
We should try to find a release manager who keeps the docs up to date and publishes releases on sourceforge. I've replaced Chris old text with this one as it was heavily outdated.

We'll need the following information in our future README:
* Compiling on various platforms
* Installing FIFE on various platforms
* Feel free to add
