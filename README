==========================
FIFE 2006.1 pre-alpha release (based on FIFE SVN rev. 594)
==========================


Intention of this release:
==========================
This is the first release that is based on the new renderbackend code. This means we've got a clear seperation between the SDL, the OpenGL and the future QT renderer for FIFEdit. This release lacks major new features from the users perspective but the we've invested a lot of time to work on the code itself. Even the next release 2006.2 will focus on creating a stable code basis for the future. Don't expect revolutionary new features before 2006.3. For more information about our roadmap, visit:
https://mirror1.cvsdude.com/trac/fife/engine/roadmap
 
We'll plan to deliver a first version of the FIFE map editor FIFEdit with the 2006.2 release. The editor is still in the concept phase; if you want to get more information about the planned editor design, visit:

Custom settings
===========================
* FIFE uses a file called "fife.settings" to give the user control about some engine aspects
* The file should be self-explanatory


Working with Fallout 1 maps:
==========================
* Copy the "master.dat" & "critter.dat" from your Fallout 1 install to your FIFE install directory
* Choose a mapname from maps_fo1.txt (located in the FIFE install dir)
* Edit the "FIFE.bat" and replace the mapname with wanted map
* Start "FIFE.bat"


Working with Fallout 2 maps:
==========================
* Copy the "master.dat" & "critter.dat" from your Fallout 2 install to your FIFE install directory
* Choose a mapname from maps_fo2.txt (located in the FIFE install dir)
* Edit the "FIFE.bat" and replace the mapname with wanted map
* Start "FIFE.bat"


Working with XML maps:
==========================
FIFE supports a (temporary) own map format so you can test the engine without having one of the Fallout games installed. The used graphics for these new maps are released under GPL and are just temporary versions. Feel free to provide us your gfx skills so we can create a high quality free FIFE map that will be featured in the next release

* Choose a mapname from maps_xml.txt (located in the FIFE install dir)
* Edit the "FIFE.bat" and replace the mapname with wanted map
* Start "FIFE.bat"
